# 🌀 babysnake-dev-journal
**Creative journal of BabySnake (Yoji Yamagami)**  
開発・音楽・デザインを横断しながら、日々の創作と学びを記録するジャーナル。  
This is where code meets melody, and design meets philosophy.

## 🌍 About Me
**Name:** Yoji Yamagami aka [BabySnake](https://babysnake.jp/)  
**GitHub:** [@ocean-road](https://github.com/ocean-road)  
**Based in:** Tokyo, Japan  
**Roles:**  
- 🎸 *Musician / Songwriter* — 1970s British rock–inspired Japanese originals & cover performances (Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, etc.)  
- 🎨 *Designer / Illustrator* — Creator of the original **“厭キャラ (Loathingamajigs)”**, grotesque yet humorous beings that blend loathing and laughter.  
  They are *“odd little spirits”* born from the tension between the eerie and the endearing — unsettling yet somehow lovable, sometimes cruel, sometimes kind.  
  *(In English, I also call them “Oddlings,” for those who prefer a gentler name.)*  
- 💻 *Developer / Maker* — Building interactive works with Python (Pyxel, Pygame) and crafting instruments such as harpsichords and pipe organs.

## 🧭 Purpose of This Repository
This repository is my **creative journal**, documenting small experiments, ideas, and reflections that shape my projects.

Each commit may contain:
- 🧠 Code experiments (Python / Pyxel / web tools)
- ✏️ Design drafts and visual notes
- 🎵 Music composition memos or DAW-related scripts
- 📓 Reflections on craftsmanship, sound, or aesthetics

In other words:  
> “A version control system for the mind of a multidisciplinary creator.”

## 🗂 Structure

/design/ → Visual drafts, layouts, and resources

## 🤝 Collaboration & Feedback
I often collaborate with **ChatGPT** to review, document, and enhance my creative process.  
AI is part of the conversation — a co-thinker, not just a tool.

If you’re interested in creative coding, instrument building, or cross-genre design,  
feel free to reach out or open an issue.

## 🌱 Current Focus
- Exploring **Pyxel** game design workflows  
- Managing **art and music assets with Git & CSV automation**  
- Studying **Baroque instrument design** and its digital reinterpretation  
- Expanding the world of **Loathingamajigs (厭キャラ)** through visual storytelling  
- Building a sustainable creative routine that connects sound, line, and logic

## 💬 Philosophy
> “Creation is not a line but a spiral — every loop brings you closer to your essence.”

This repository is my spiral.  
Every commit is a step, every diff is a reflection, every tag is a memory.

### Journal
2025-11-05 最初のコミット。今日は8:30-18:30まで、フルタイムで勤務したが、こうやってGitHubと向き合っている。1ヶ月前だと考えられないが。焦らず、たゆまず、ぼちぼちいこう。

*2025-11-05 — First Commit.*  
*After working from 8:30 to 18:30, I sat down to face GitHub for the first time.  
A month ago, I couldn’t have imagined this step. Slow and steady — that’s the rhythm I’ll follow.*
